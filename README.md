# Thuto
It is some code I gathered from old project and I think I can reuse, instead of copy past it in my new projects (I did this too much sadly) I decided to make a library out of it, but it is essentially for my personnal usage, so no documentation for now and it is not very mature, API may change a lot.

It requires C++20 and a recent version of cmake.

Also, don't mind the edgy commit messages ;)
